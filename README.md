## 🧠 Internship Overview

This internship was designed to provide practical exposure to real-world problems in the industry using Data Science and Machine Learning. I worked on **two capstone projects**:

1. ✅ **Crop and Weed Detection**  
2. ✅ **Predict Lifetime of a Bearing in Manufacturing Industry**

Each project involved learning concepts, data handling, model development, evaluation, and full technical reporting.
